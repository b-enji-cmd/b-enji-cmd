### Who I Am
I'm a software developer located in Denver, a proud graduate (still a student at the moment of writing this) of the Turing School of Software and Design. An amazing school that -over 1500 hours across 7 months- equips you with the tools and mindset to make your place in the world as a software developer. I love. Love. LOVE. Learning. It's my favorite thing to do, exploring new things and getting stuck is my typical way of doing things.

```
You are a back-end developer working on a team that is building an application to plan road trips. This app will allow users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at the destination.

Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture. The front-end will communicate with your back-end through an API. Your job is to expose that API that satisfies the front-end teamâ€™s requirements.
