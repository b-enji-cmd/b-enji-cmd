# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## _I'm Ben!_
<!-- Who I Am -->
### Who I Am
I'm a software developer located in Denver, a proud graduate (still a student at the moment of writing this) of the Turing School of Software and Design. An amazing school that -over 1500 hours across 7 months- equips you with the tools and mindset to make your place in the world as a software developer. I love. Love. LOVE. Learning. It's my favorite thing to do, exploring new things and getting stuck is my typical way of doing things.
