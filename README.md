### Who I Am
I'm a software developer located in Denver, a proud graduate (still a student at the moment of writing this) of the Turing School of Software and Design. An amazing school that -over 1500 hours across 7 months- equips you with the tools and mindset to make your place in the world as a software developer. I love. Love. LOVE. Learning. It's my favorite thing to do, exploring new things and getting stuck is my typical way of doing things.

> #### Mesh
```
Mesh is a platform built to consolidate and standardize feedback given throughout the course of your time at Turing. Students can see and reflect back on the 
past feedback they have been given for every module and every project. Each module has a standardized grading rubric so every student is graded the same and can 
identify places where they can improve
